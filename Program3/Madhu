A program to input elements in array from user and count duplicate elements in array. Program to find all duplicate elements in an unsorted array. 

Example

Input
Input array elements: 1, 10, 20, 1, 25, 1, 10, 30, 25, 1

Output
Total number of duplicate elements = 5



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int code[10]={1,10,20,1,25,1,10,30,25,1};
    int store[10];
    int present=0;
    int n=10;
    int count=0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {   
        
                                  /* EXTRA for (int k = 0; k < 10; k++)
                                     {
                                         if(store[k]==code[i])
                                         present=present+1;

                                     }*/
       for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++)
       {    if( present==0){

          if(code[i]==code[j]){
               count=count+1;
               cout<< "Success"<<code[i]<<" "<<code[j]<<endl;
               break;
                                       /*for (int k = 0; k < 10; k++)
                                       {
                                           store[k]=code[i];
                                           break;
                                       }    extra*/
               
           }

       }

       }
       
    }
    
    cout<<" Total="<<count;
    return 0;
}

NOTE:
Approach: If the no were redundant more than once the code calculated that also..
          So thought of storing the ele in another array and do the comparison if it was not present in the new array.   
          But didn't work. output for the given i/p was 8.
          
          View2- The problem was I compared the selected ele with all the other ele in array so there was redundency,this was solved by adding a simple break statement
                  which counts only one duplicate element ahead
